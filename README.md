# Bike challenge 2021
## Visualization part

This repository contains my work for an individual challenge based on bike traffic visualization in Montpellier, as part of my [HMMA238 course in 'Software devlopment'](https://github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238).

My idea was to provide a simple visualization tool using Montpellier Méditerrannée Open Data relative to bike traffic, available [here](https://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs). I created a map using the python folium package, using geojson files containing geographic coordinates of the different totems of Montpellier and surroundings. I represented those on a map and added some traffic informations relative to each of these, such as traffic record, mean daily traffic, adress... The other widget is an interactive plot, made with the plotly library, for which one can select a totem and see both the daily and weekly traffic intensity through time. The graphs provides are interactive as well, and it is possible to focus on a given time period.

## Repository architecture

* `main folder`
    * `ride_on_dash.py`: the main file generating the dash application
    * `geoinfo.csv`: a cleaned dataset containing both geographic and traffic-related informations, generated by
    * `totem_map.html`: the folium map generated by 
    * ...and some needed 'maintenance' files...
* `assets`
    * `bootstrap.min.css` : Bootstrap templates for 'web design' purpose.
