# HMMA238 - Bike challenge 2021
## Visualization part

This repository contains my work for an individual challenge based on bike traffic visualization in Montpellier, as part of my [HMMA238 course in 'Software devlopment'](https://github.com/bcharlier/HMMA238).

The final result is [this Dash application](http:/amelievernay.pythonanywhere.com/), hosted on the webby [pythonanywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/).

My idea was to provide a simple visualization tool using Montpellier Méditerrannée Open Data relative to bike traffic, available [here](https://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-eco-compteurs). I created a map using the python folium package, using geojson files containing geographic coordinates of the different totems of Montpellier and surroundings. I represented those on a map and added some traffic informations relative to each of these, such as traffic record, mean daily traffic, adresses... The second widget is an interactive plot, made with the plotly library, for which one can select a totem and see both the daily and weekly traffic intensity through time. The graphs provided are interactive as well, and it is possible to focus on a given time period. The third widget is an animated and interactive map, also displaying bike traffic intensity through time.

## Repository architecture

* `main folder`
    * `ride_on_dash.py`: the main file generating the dash application
    * `geoinfo.csv`: a cleaned dataset containing both geographic and traffic-related informations, generated by `extracting_geoinfo.py`
    * `totem_map.html`: the folium map generated by `make_totem_map.py`
    * `bunnle_map.html`: the animated map generated by `make_bubble_map.py`
    * ...and some needed 'maintenance' files...
    * `scripts`
        * `extracting_geoinfo.py`
        * `make_totem_map.py`
        * `make_bubble_map.py`
        * `coordinates.csv`: generated by `extracting_geoinfo.py` and used in `make_totem_map.py`
    * `assets`
        * `bootstrap.min.css` : Bootstrap templates for 'web design' purpose.

While working on his project, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOWVat5BgM4&list=TLPQMjcwMzIwMjHCyNnQBOYOow&index=2) helped me deploy my application on the web using pythonanywhere, and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9biKWoGK3j0&list=PL2UmzTIzxgL4GUqBPhGcpMe5BTOp0Ovqv&index=4) helped me understand the folium library. I also used, as for many of my other projects, the [Medium online publishing platform](https://medium.com/).
